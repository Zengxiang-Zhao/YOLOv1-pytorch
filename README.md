# YOLOv1-pytorch
This project will implement the YOLOv1 based on the paper ["You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" ]() from scratch. 

After that I'm gonna try to implemente othe new techniques in the model to check whether this technique could improve the model.

The purpose of this project is just to train my skills, such as python, pytorch, numpy and etc. And whether I can convert the paper ideas into code and implement them into the YOLO model.
Some of the code come from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3)
